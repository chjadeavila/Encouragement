  <h1>Giving up shouldn't be a Thing!</h1>
  <p>It's been a month since I started to learn about coding, it's just html and css, the markup languages. I thought of giving up so many times, while practicing I couldn't really get it, why can't I get it?...it's always like that, I stressed myself about such thing, things that I'm so weak, so dumb, and yes while thinking that I'm dumb, thinking about giving up,..I still didn't let such thing stop me from doing what I want, I just keep on going, and going, and going, I didn't stop practicing, 'cause yes, in practice we trust, in practice we improve, no matter what happen, we should not stop reaching what we really want. Keep your chin up, we got your back. Keep your heads up just keep on dreaming!!!</p>
